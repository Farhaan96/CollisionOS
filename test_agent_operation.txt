This is a test file to verify that the enhanced loop detector allows legitimate agent operations.

The improvements implemented:

1. Context-aware detection - recognizes agent coordination operations
2. Progressive warnings - warns before blocking
3. Higher thresholds for legitimate operations
4. Smart failure categorization - doesn't count agent operation failures as consecutive
5. Reduced cooldowns for agent operations
6. Enhanced status reporting

Agent operation patterns recognized:
- Files in: components/, src/, lib/, services/, api/, pages/, dashboard/
- File types: .ts, .js, .jsx, .tsx, .vue, .css, .scss
- Safe contexts: agent-coordination, multi-file-operation, dashboard-generation, etc.
