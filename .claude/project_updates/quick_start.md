# 🚀 QUICK START - Copy & Paste This

**I'm working on CollisionOS - an auto body shop management desktop app (React + Node.js + Electron + SQLite/Supabase).**

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
1. **Read project status**: `Read all files in .claude/project_updates/`
2. **Contact architect for task assignment**: Use this exact message:
   ```
   I need a task assignment. I've read the project updates and understand the current status. 
   Please assign me the highest priority task that matches my capabilities.
   ```
3. **Follow agent protocols**: Update your progress file after ANY code change

## CURRENT CRITICAL ISSUES:
- **Backend**: TypeScript errors in `server/services/import/bms_parser.ts` (Decimal/XMLParser type issues)
- **Frontend**: Missing `@mui/x-data-grid` and `@mui/x-date-pickers` dependencies
- **App**: Won't start due to compilation errors

## AGENT ROLES & CAPABILITIES:
- **architect**: Lead coordinator & task delegator (`.claude/project_updates/architect_progress.md`)
- **backend-api**: APIs, server logic, TypeScript fixes, database integration (`.claude/project_updates/backend_progress.md`)
- **frontend-ui**: React components, UI/UX, dependency management, build issues (`.claude/project_updates/frontend_progress.md`)
- **db-architect**: Database schema, migrations, performance, data modeling (`.claude/project_updates/database_progress.md`)
- **devops**: CI/CD, deployment, environment setup, build configuration (`.claude/project_updates/devops_progress.md`)
- **test-runner**: Test creation, bug fixes, test execution, coverage (`.claude/project_updates/testing_progress.md`)

## ARCHITECT COORDINATION PROTOCOL:
1. **Contact architect** with the message above
2. **Receive task assignment** with specific instructions
3. **Execute the task** following the assignment details
4. **Update your progress file** after completion
5. **Report back to architect** if you encounter blockers

## MANDATORY UPDATES:
After ANY code change, update your agent's progress file with timestamp, what was done, why, and impact.

**Start by reading the project updates and contacting the architect agent for task assignment!**
