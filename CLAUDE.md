# CLAUDE.md - CollisionOS Auto Body Shop Management System

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with the CollisionOS collision repair management system.

## 🚀 Quick Reference - Streamlined for Speed

**System Status**: ✅ 70% Complete - Production-Ready Foundation Built
**Model**: `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`
**Architecture**: **5 core** + 3 lightweight agents

### Core 5 Agents (Use These)

1. **orchestrator** - Complex multi-step tasks (delegates automatically)
2. **architect** - Planning & breakdown (when you need structure)
3. **bms-specialist** - Collision repair domain expert (XML/insurance only)
4. **code-generator** - ALL code (frontend, backend, database, everything)
5. **test-runner** - Testing & validation (ship with confidence)

### Lightweight 3 (On-demand Only)

6. **code-reviewer** - Quick security check (3min, showstoppers only)
7. **debugger** - Fast fixes (10min, get it working)
8. **search-agent** - Codebase search (30sec, find stuff fast)

### Simple Decision Tree

```
Need to build something?     → code-generator
Complex multi-step task?     → orchestrator → delegates to others
BMS/Insurance specific?       → bms-specialist
Something broke?              → debugger
Need to find code?            → search-agent
Ready to ship?                → test-runner
Pre-commit check?             → code-reviewer
```

## 🎓 Important Guidelines

### DO:
- Always consider insurance workflow requirements
- Maintain 1:1 claim-to-RO relationship integrity
- Test BMS ingestion with realistic XML samples
- Optimize for parts workflow performance
- Update progress files after changes

### DON'T:
- Break the BMS ingestion pipeline
- Skip testing collision repair workflows
- Ignore vendor integration requirements
- Create generic auto shop features without insurance context

### ALWAYS:
- Check collision repair business logic before changes
- Test BMS XML parsing with various formats
- Validate parts workflow state transitions
- Consider multi-vendor scenarios
- Document collision repair-specific decisions
- Coordinate through the architect for complex changes

## 🚀 Getting Started (Quick Start)

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Supabase account (for cloud features)
- Git

### Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/collision-os.git
cd collision-os

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up environment
copy env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Supabase credentials

# Initialize database
npm run db:migrate
npm run db:seed

# Start development
npm run dev
```

### Next Steps After Installation

1. **Phase 1 Stabilization** (2-4 hours)
   - Fix frontend field mappings
   - Connect search page to backend
   - Test end-to-end workflow

2. **Phase 2 Financial Integration** (2 weeks)
   - Implement payment processing
   - Add expense tracking
   - Integrate QuickBooks

3. **Phase 3 Mobile Apps** (3 weeks)
   - Build technician mobile app
   - Create customer portal
   - Add SMS communication

---

## 📊 Session Best Practices

### Multi-Agent Orchestration
- **Orchestrator-Worker Pattern**: Orchestrator delegates to specialized workers
- **Parallel Execution**: Up to 4 concurrent agents for independent tasks
- **Subagent Delegation**: Agents proactively delegate when beneficial
- **Context Sharing**: Use `.claude/project_updates/` for cross-agent communication

### Session Management
1. **Start**: Review all `.claude/project_updates/` files for context
2. **During**: Update progress files every 15-30 minutes
3. **Before context limit**: Create checkpoint and save state
4. **Continuation**: Load checkpoint state in fresh context window
5. **End**: Comprehensive update of all relevant progress files

### Performance Optimization
- **Parallel tool calls**: Batch independent operations in single message
- **Context caching**: Leverage file-based memory for repeated access
- **Progressive search**: Start broad, narrow based on results
- **Efficient hooks**: Reduced cooldowns (300ms) for agent coordination

## 🎨 Part 2: User Interface and User Experience Design

This section covers the UI/UX design strategy for CollisionOS, ensuring that despite the broad functionality, the application remains intuitive and easy to use for all user types. A well-designed interface is critical for adoption in a busy shop environment – the software should streamline work, not complicate it.

### 2.1 Design Principles and Aesthetics

**Clarity and Simplicity**:
- Clean dashboard approach for home screen highlighting critical info and alerts
- Logical navigation grouping with clear labels
- Shallow menu hierarchy – frequent actions 1-2 clicks away
- Consistent design language (colors, typography, iconography) across web and mobile
- Modern design trends (flat design, intuitive icons, responsive layouts)
- Minimal training required for non-tech-savvy shop staff

**Role-Based Interfaces**:
- Tailored UI per user role to reduce clutter
- **Technician**: Focused view with assigned jobs, clock in/out, status updates
- **Receptionist**: Calendar, appointments, quick customer/check-in links
- **Admin/Owner**: KPI dashboard with full menu access
- Show users only what they need for their job

**Responsive and Platform-Appropriate Design**:
- Web app responsive to various screen sizes
- Desktop/large monitor: Multi-column layouts, data tables, charts
- Tablet touchscreen: Readable buttons and text
- Dedicated mobile apps: Native design conventions (Material Design/iOS HIG)
- Mobile-specific screens for focused tasks (not shrunk web UI)

**Visual Hierarchy and Emphasis**:
- Color-code work order status (green = on track, yellow = delayed, red = urgent)
- Highlight important alerts with badges/notification icons
- Emphasize required fields on forms
- Use modals/wizards for multi-step processes (e.g., estimate creation)
- Prominent primary action buttons, smaller secondary actions
- Professional look with shop's branding (logo, customizable colors)

**Performance and Feedback**:
- Snappy UI with loading indicators/skeleton screens
- Confirmation messages for actions (toast notifications)
- Clear error messages
- Visual feedback on actions (checkmarks, progress indicators)
- Caching frequently used data (parts list)
- Local storage for temporary mobile data when offline

### 2.2 Web Application UI (Shop Owner/Manager & Office Staff)

The web app is the control center for managers and office staff, used on desktop computers.

**Main Dashboard**:
- Summary widgets: cars in progress, avg cycle time, monthly sales, unpaid invoices
- Interactive shop status board
- Charts for trends (sales over time, profits)
- Notification area (appointments today, parts awaiting approval)
- One-glance health check of business

**Top/Side Navigation**:
- Clear navigation scheme (left sidebar or top bar with dropdowns)
- Icons with text labels (calendar for Schedule, car for ROs, dollar for Invoicing)
- Collapsible sidebar for larger screens
- Breadcrumbs for multi-level navigation

**Scheduling Calendar UI**:
- Calendar view (day/week/month toggles)
- Color-coded entries (customer appointments vs. production milestones)

- Search bar (by name or RO#)
- **RO Detail Page** (central hub):
  - Tabs/sections: Overview, Parts, Labor/Tasks, Attachments, Messages, Invoices/Payments
  - Expandable panels for clean UI
  - Image thumbnails (click to enlarge)
  - Clear action buttons (+ Add Part, Edit RO, Order)

- Wizard option for new users
- "Convert to Invoice" button from estimates
- WYSIWYG preview for printing/emailing

**Inventory/Parts UI**:

- **Order Parts Dialog**:
  - Supplier selection (Keystone, CollisionLink, etc.)
  - Integration confirmations ("Part ordered, expected in 2 days")
  - Smooth workflow for parts ordering

**Reporting UI**:
- Report selection (Monthly P/L, Tech Efficiency, Inventory Usage)
- Filters and date ranges
- On-screen charts/tables (data visualization libraries)
- Export functionality
- Consistent design with dashboard

**Settings & Configuration**:

- Dark mode option
- Ensure buttons not too small for touch

### 2.3 Mobile App UI (Technicians and Customers)

Two distinct mobile interfaces: technician app and customer app.

#### Technician Mobile App

**Job List & Details**:

- Avoid tiny text or outdated skeuomorphic elements
- Flat icons, crisp typography, good padding

**Intuitive Icons & Labels**:

- Calendar for scheduling, clipboard for work orders, dollar for accounting, gear for settings

**Consistency**:
- Consistent layout template across screens
- Header bar with page title and key actions
- Global color scheme for statuses (green = Completed everywhere)
- Helps users predict and learn interface

**High Contrast & Readability**:
- High-contrast text (dark on light or vice versa)
